      "\n",
      "Well there you have it: 4 different ways to solve Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain using a finite volume approach. And why look at 4 approaches? There are a few reasons: in both the E-B and H-J implementations, we have the option to use primary-secondary (or not) depending on the type of source we are dealing with. Also, between the E-B and H-J implementations, we change where things live. I am particularly interested in this point when we reduce the dimensionality of the problem and use a cylindrically symmetric implementation. In the 2D cylindrical mesh, the edges are circles and lie only in the horizontal plane, while faces are vertical and radial. So the field we model only has an azimuthal component, while the flux has a vertical and radial components. If we want to model a vertical magnetic dipole, then we expect the magnetic flux to have vertical and radial components (no azimuthal component), while the resulting electric field will have only an azimuthal component. In this scenario, we should use the E-B formulation since then $\\mathbf{e}$ lives on the edges and $\\mathbf{b}$ on the faces. However, if we wanted to inject current vertically, we need the current density $\\mathbf{j}$ to be defined on faces and have the magnetic field $\\mathbf{h}$ on edges. Depending on the source and problem you are looking at, there may be one approach that is more suitable than the others, and now you have all of them at your fingertips in [simpegEM](https://github.com/simpeg/simpegem)."
