      "Geophysical surveys consist of a similar basic framework. An energy source is delivered into the earth, which can be natural (for example, the Earth's magnetic field) or human-made (current in the ground, acoustic wave energy, etc.), and this stimulates a response according to the variation in physical properties in the subsurface. At the surface, receivers pick up the a signal and record this as data. <br>\n",

The model, $m(x,y,z)$, represents the distribution of a physical property in the volume.
